# Traffic Collision ML Analysis Code - Detailed Explanation

## Overview
This code analyzes traffic collision data using machine learning to predict risk levels based on various factors.

## Section 1: Import Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

**What each library does:**
- **`pandas`** → Data manipulation (like Excel for Python)
- **`numpy`** → Mathematical operations on arrays
- **`sklearn`** → Machine learning tools
  - **`train_test_split`** → Splits data for training/testing
  - **`RandomForestClassifier`** → The AI model we're using
  - **`metrics`** → Tools to measure how good our model is
- **`matplotlib`** → Creates basic plots and charts
- **`seaborn`** → Makes prettier charts

## Section 2: Load Data
```python
data = pd.read_csv("/content/traffic_collision_data_with_routes.csv")
print(data.columns)
```

**What it does:**
- **`pd.read_csv()`** → Loads a CSV file into a DataFrame (like a spreadsheet)
- **`print(data.columns)`** → Shows all column names in the data

**Real-world meaning:** "Load the traffic accident data file and show me what information we have"

## Section 3: Create Risk Categories
```python
if 'Vehicles' in data.columns:
    def calculate_risk(vehicles):
        if vehicles > 12:
            return "High"
        elif 8 <= vehicles <= 12:
            return "Medium"
        else:
            return "Low"
    data['Risk_Level'] = data['Vehicles'].apply(calculate_risk)
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`if 'Vehicles' in data.columns`** → Check if we have vehicle count data
- **`def calculate_risk(vehicles)`** → Create a function to categorize risk
- **Risk Logic:**
  - More than 12 vehicles = "High" risk
  - 8-12 vehicles = "Medium" risk  
  - Less than 8 vehicles = "Low" risk
- **`data['Vehicles'].apply(calculate_risk)`** → Apply this function to every row

**Real-world meaning:** "Create risk categories based on how many vehicles were involved in each accident"

## Section 4: Prepare Data for Machine Learning
```python
features = data.drop(columns=["Risk_Level"])  # Input data
labels = data["Risk_Level"]  # What we want to predict
```

**What it does:**
- **`features`** → All the information we'll use to make predictions (everything except risk level)
- **`labels`** → What we want the AI to learn to predict (the risk level)

**Think of it like:** Features = "Given this information..." Labels = "...predict this outcome"

## Section 5: Convert Text to Numbers
```python
categorical_columns = features.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
features_encoded = pd.get_dummies(features, columns=categorical_columns, drop_first=True)
```

**What it does:**
- **`select_dtypes(include=['object'])`** → Find columns with text data
- **`pd.get_dummies()`** → Convert text categories to numbers

**Example:** 
- Text: "Red", "Blue", "Green"
- Numbers: Red=1,0,0  Blue=0,1,0  Green=0,0,1

**Why:** Computers can only work with numbers, not words

## Section 6: Split Data for Training and Testing
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_encoded, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

**What it does:**
- **70%** of data → Train the AI model
- **30%** of data → Test how good the AI is
- **`random_state=42`** → Makes results reproducible

**Real-world analogy:** Like studying with 70% of questions, then taking a test with the remaining 30%

## Section 7: Train the AI Model
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**What it does:**
- **`RandomForestClassifier`** → Type of AI model (like having 100 decision trees voting)
- **`n_estimators=100`** → Use 100 decision trees
- **`model.fit()`** → Train the model with our training data

**Real-world meaning:** "Teach the AI to recognize patterns between accident features and risk levels"

## Section 8: Make Predictions
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**What it does:**
- **`model.predict()`** → Ask the trained AI to predict risk levels for test data
- **`y_pred`** → The AI's guesses

**Real-world meaning:** "Now that the AI is trained, let's see how well it predicts risk on new data"

## Section 9: Evaluate Performance
```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**What it does:**
- **`accuracy_score()`** → Compare AI's guesses vs. actual answers
- **`classification_report()`** → Detailed performance breakdown

**Real-world meaning:** 
- Accuracy = "The AI got 85% of predictions correct"
- Report = Shows performance for each risk category

## Section 10: Confusion Matrix
```python
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
```

**What it does:**
- **`confusion_matrix()`** → Create a table showing correct vs incorrect predictions
- **`sns.heatmap()`** → Make a colored chart of the results

**Example of what it shows:**
```
           Predicted
         Low Med High
Actual Low  50   5    1
      Med   3  40    7  
     High   1   4   45
```

## Section 11: Feature Importance
```python
importances = model.feature_importances_
sns.barplot(x=importances, y=feature_names)
```

**What it does:**
- **`feature_importances_`** → Shows which factors matter most for predictions
- **`sns.barplot()`** → Creates a bar chart

**Real-world meaning:** "Which factors (weather, time of day, road type, etc.) are most important for predicting accident risk?"

## Key Programming Concepts:

### Variables:
- **`data`** = The loaded CSV file
- **`features`** = Input information for predictions
- **`labels`** = What we want to predict
- **`model`** = The trained AI

### Functions:
- **`calculate_risk()`** = Custom function to categorize risk
- **`train_test_split()`** = Built-in function to split data
- **`model.fit()`** = Method to train the AI

### Data Flow:
1. **Load** traffic accident data
2. **Clean** and categorize the data
3. **Split** into training and testing sets
4. **Train** an AI model on patterns
5. **Test** the model's accuracy
6. **Visualize** the results

## Real-World Application:
This code could help:
- **Traffic departments** identify high-risk intersections
- **Insurance companies** assess accident likelihood
- **City planners** improve road safety
- **Emergency services** allocate resources

## Output Example:
```
Accuracy: 0.87
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score
         Low      0.91      0.89      0.90
      Medium      0.80      0.83      0.81
        High      0.89      0.88      0.89
```

This means the AI correctly predicts accident risk 87% of the time!
